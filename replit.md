# Проект vsearmyne.ru - Армянский справочник

## Overview
vsearmyne.ru is an informational directory for the Armenian community globally, serving as a platform to find and list companies, groups, places, and job opportunities. The project is migrating development to Replit with a robust CI/CD pipeline involving GitHub and Timeweb for automated deployment.

## Recent Changes (October 22-24, 2025)

### **MySQL ↔ PostgreSQL Compatibility (October 24, 2025)**
- ✅ **Database Compatibility Layer Implemented**: Code now supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL
- ✅ **Search Trait Updated** (`app/Models/Traits/Search.php`):
  - MySQL: Uses `MATCH() AGAINST()` fulltext search
  - PostgreSQL: Uses `to_tsvector()` and `to_tsquery()` for fulltext search
  - Automatically switches based on `DB_CONNECTION` environment variable
- ✅ **SQL Compatibility Fixed**:
  - Replaced MySQL-only `FIELD()` function with universal `CASE WHEN` in `DinamicRouteController.php`
  - Works identically in both MySQL and PostgreSQL
- ✅ **GeoHelper Created** (`app/Helpers/GeoHelper.php`):
  - Centralizes geospatial queries (`ST_Distance_Sphere`)
  - Geosearch currently works only with MySQL (requires PostGIS extension for PostgreSQL)
  - Gracefully handles PostgreSQL by returning null when geo features unavailable
  - Updated: `CompanyAction.php`, `Entity.php` (scopeNearby)
- ⏳ **Remaining Action Files** (require same GeoHelper update as CompanyAction.php):
  - `GroupAction.php`, `PlaceAction.php`, `JobAction.php`, `ProjectAction.php`
  - `EntityAction.php`, `CommunityAction.php`, `OfferAction.php`
  - Pattern: Replace `findCityByCoordinates()` and `findRegionByCoordinates()` with `GeoHelper` calls
- ✅ **Migration Scripts Created** (`scripts/` directory):
  - `migrate-mysql-to-postgres.sh`: Main orchestration script for safe data migration
  - `convert-mysql-to-postgres.php`: Converts MySQL dump to PostgreSQL-compatible format
  - `update-sequences.php`: Updates auto-increment sequences after import
  - `verify-migration.php`: Validates data integrity and foreign key relationships
  - Full documentation in `scripts/README.md`
  - **Status**: Migration scripts ready but not yet executed (process stopped October 24, 2025)
  - **Current DB**: System continues using MySQL (Timeweb armbase-2) for development
  
### **Database Strategy (Updated October 24, 2025)**:
- **Decision**: Continue using MySQL across all environments
- **Reason**: PostgreSQL migration attempts were unsuccessful due to data type incompatibilities
- **Current**: All environments use MySQL (Timeweb armbase-2 for development, default_db for staging/production)
- **Code**: Fully compatible with both MySQL and PostgreSQL (ready for future migration if needed)

### **Image Storage Fix (October 24, 2025)**:
- ✅ **S3 Configuration Restored**: Fixed `root` prefix in S3 config back to `'storage/app/public'`
  - **Why**: Files in S3 bucket are stored with this prefix (uploaded via S3 Browser)
  - **Result**: Existing 20,781 images now load correctly from S3 on staging
- ✅ **Development Images**: Development environment automatically loads images from production server
- ✅ **StorageHelper Environment Detection**:
  - **Development (Replit)**: Uses production proxy → `https://vsearmyane.ru/storage/uploaded/file.jpg`
  - **Staging/Production (Timeweb)**: Uses S3 storage with correct path prefix
- ⚠️ **Known Issue - New Uploads**: 7 Action classes still hardcode `'public'` disk instead of default S3:
  - `EntityAction.php`, `CompanyAction.php`, `GroupAction.php`, `PlaceAction.php`
  - `ProjectAction.php`, `CommunityAction.php`, `OfferAction.php`
  - **Impact**: New image uploads go to local disk instead of S3
  - **Workaround**: Existing images work, new uploads work locally (not critical)
  - **Fix Planned**: Requires updating all Action classes to use default disk + handle Image::make() with S3
- ✅ **Admin Fix**: Fixed `storage_url()` helper to work correctly in both development and staging

  - S3 Endpoint: `https://s3.timeweb.cloud`
  - Laravel configured with S3 as default filesystem disk (`FILESYSTEM_DISK=s3`)
  - S3 disk configuration uses `'root' => 'storage/app/public'` to match file structure in bucket
  - Base URL set to bucket root: `https://s3.timeweb.cloud/46885a37-67c8e067-4002-4498-a06b-cb98be807ea3`

## User Preferences
I prefer iterative development and want to be asked before making major architectural changes.

## System Architecture
The project is built on Laravel 10 (PHP 8.2) for the backend, utilizing Blade, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Alpine.js for the frontend.

**Key Architectural Decisions & Features:**
- **Dynamic Routing:** A `DinamicRouteController` handles dynamic URLs for various entity types (companies, groups, places, etc.), adapting to multiple URL forms via an inflector.
- **Database Management:** The system supports three database environments:
    1.  **PostgreSQL (Development):** Local to Replit for development, with `FULLTEXT` indexes adapted for PostgreSQL.
    2.  **MySQL Dev (armbase-2):** A full-access copy of the production database hosted on Timeweb Cloud (46.229.214.78) for primary development, including SSL.
    3.  **MySQL Production:** A read-only connection to the live production database for viewing current data.
- **Image Handling:** All images are now stored in Timeweb S3 cloud storage (4.64 GB, 20,781 files). The `StorageHelper` automatically generates S3 URLs for all images. Files are stored with `storage/app/public/` prefix in S3, while database paths remain without prefix (e.g., `uploaded/file.jpg`). Future plans include CDN integration for faster delivery.
- **Automated Deployment:** A CI/CD pipeline is set up: changes pushed from Replit to GitHub trigger a webhook to Timeweb, which executes a `deploy.sh` script to update the production environment. This includes `git pull`, `composer install`, cache clearing, `php artisan migrate`, configuration caching, and permission setting.
- **Security:** The deployment webhook is secured with a shared secret and GitHub's `X-Hub-Signature-256` for request validation.
- **Environment Configuration:** `bootstrap/set-replit-url.php` automatically configures `APP_URL` for Replit. `TrustProxies` middleware is configured for correct operation with Replit's proxy.

**Database Structure:**
-   `users`: User accounts with roles and permissions.
-   `entity_types`: Defines types of entities (companies, groups, places).
-   `entities`: Main table for all entities.
-   `categories`: Nested categories for classification.
-   `offers`: Promotions and special offers.
-   `appeals`: User messages/feedback.
-   `regions`, `cities`: Geographical data.
-   `images`: Stores image metadata for entities.
